#This is my final project for csc 365 Internet Programing class

For this project, we use The Movie DB api to shows the movie search or tv search results to the users.

First, we set every user need to login with their google account so they can begin to our websit.

Second, when the user search movie or tv from our website we will use the api to get result and show it to the user.
